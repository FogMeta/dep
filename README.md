# DEP

## Project Overview

DEP (Deployment Enabler Platform) is a cross-platform application deployment project designed to help users easily deploy their applications to the [AKASH Network](https://akash.network) and [Lagrange Platform](https://lagrangedao.org). DEP offers various deployment methods, including building images using Dockerfiles and deploying applications using SDL (YAML) files.

## Key Features

DEP provides the following key features:

1. **Building Image From Dockerfile:** DEP allows users to build application images using Dockerfiles, making it easy to deploy and manage applications.

2. **Deploy to AKASH Network:** DEP supports deploying your applications to the [AKASH Network](https://akash.network), a distributed cloud computing platform that provides a reliable hosting environment for your applications.

3. **Deploy to Lagrange Platform:** DEP integrates with the [Lagrange Platform](https://lagrangedao.org), enabling you to deploy your applications to this powerful blockchain platform.(**coming soon**)

4. **One-Click Deploy Lagrange Space to AKASH Network:** DEP offers one-click deployment, allowing you to quickly deploy applications, including Dockerfile and images, from Lagrange Platform to the [AKASH Network](https://akash.network), simplifying the cross-platform deployment process.

5. **Retrieve Access URLs:** DEP provides the functionality to retrieve access URLs for your deployed applications.

### Prerequisites

Before using DEP, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system.
