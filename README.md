# DEP Project

## Project Overview

DEP (Deployment Enabler Platform) is a cross-platform application deployment project designed to help users easily deploy their applications to the [AKASH Network](https://akash.network) and [Lagrange Platform](https://lagrangedao.org). DEP offers various deployment methods, including building images using Dockerfiles and deploying applications using SDL (YAML) files.

## Key Features

DEP provides the following key features:

1. **Dockerfile Image Building Support:** DEP allows users to build application images using Dockerfiles, making it easy to deploy and manage applications.

2. **Deployment to AKASH Network:** DEP supports deploying your applications to the [AKASH Network](https://akash.network), a distributed cloud computing platform that provides a reliable hosting environment for your applications.

3. **Deployment to Lagrange Platform:** DEP integrates with the [Lagrange Platform](https://lagrangedao.org), enabling you to deploy your applications to this powerful blockchain platform.

4. **One-Click Deployment to AKASH Network:** DEP offers one-click deployment, allowing you to quickly deploy applications, including Dockerfiles and images, from Lagrange Platform to the [AKASH Network](https://akash.network), simplifying the cross-platform deployment process.

5. **Retrieve Access URLs:** DEP provides the functionality to retrieve access URLs for your deployed applications.
